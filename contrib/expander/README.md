# Programmable Pico Module / EuroPi Expander

Very rough work in progress. More to come...

Analog/Digital CV inputs and outputs. 128x64 OLED display. Joystick+button input controller.

Currently a rough draft prototype. I intend to play with this a bit and see what else it needs to be more useful, then I'll refactor the design into a eurorack mountable format.
